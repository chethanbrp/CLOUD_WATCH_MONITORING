# CLOUD_WATCH_MONITORING

Here I have monitored the CPU Utilization of an EC2 instance by using the Cloud Watch and
here to trigger the CPU Utilization I used the Python file to trigger from 0 to 100

 Monitoring CPU Utilization is done in two ways,
 1. CloudWatch Metric.
 2. CloudWatch Alarm [SNS].
